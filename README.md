# Python_Basics

This is simply an area for me to continually practice Python skills. Will be utilizing resources such as "Python Crash Course" by Eric Matthews for examples and practice sets. 

I will continually update this area to reflect any new sources of information I am working out of as well as any notes to the reader I think may be relevant to understanding my aim.
